ASLR
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization

is controlled under Linux via /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
It will randomize memory addresses and thus pointers
and also initialize certain memory with random values.

ASLR can also be disabled per process using `setarch $(arch) -R make`

But the proper fix for cases like 1.c is to use memset or bzero.
