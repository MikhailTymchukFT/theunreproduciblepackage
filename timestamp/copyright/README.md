Some software and documentation uses the year of build
in copyright strings.

As long as this only touches comments in .c or .h files,
it will only alter the build-id in the resulting binary.

However, building today's software in 2037 and getting a
`Copyright Â© 2002-2037 THEAUTHORS`
is wrong, because nobody authored anything in 2037 in this version.

Projects are better off manually updating the year with git commits
or updating the date from a ChangeLog or input file mtime
so it remains constant for release tarballs.
