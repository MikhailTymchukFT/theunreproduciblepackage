The Unreproducible Package

is meant as a practical way to demonstrate the various ways
that software can break reproducible builds
using just low level primitives without requiring external existing programs
that implement these primitives themselves.

It is structured so that one subdirectory demonstrates one class of issues
in some variants observed in the wild.

See https://reproducible-builds.org/ for background info.
